# Testing

Every change ships with tests (AGENTS.md, "Full test coverage"). This page says how to run them.
Local toolchain: Xcode 27.2 with the iOS 27.2 Simulator. The app supports iOS and iPadOS 18.0
and later.

## Quick checks (seconds, no build)

```sh
scripts/check-repo.sh
scripts/test-check-security.sh && scripts/check-security.sh
scripts/test-check-architecture.sh && scripts/check-architecture.sh
scripts/test-check-localization.sh && scripts/check-localization.sh
scripts/test-check-coverage.sh
```

`check-security.sh` reads tracked files only (`git ls-files`), so stage new files before running
it.

## Unit tests and coverage

The logic modules are tested with Swift Testing, against fakes of the hardware protocols:

```sh
xcodebuild test -scheme NopeKit-Package \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro,OS=27.2' \
  -derivedDataPath DerivedData -enableCodeCoverage YES CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
scripts/check-coverage.sh DerivedData
```

`check-coverage.sh` requires 100% of lines and regions in `NopeCore`, `NopeCapture`,
`NopeDevelop` and `NopeSigning`. Swift's coverage data records each branch arm (each `switch`
case, each side of a ternary or `guard`) as a region and has no separate branch records, so
100% region coverage is how branch coverage is measured; branch records are checked too if a
future toolchain emits them.

The only files excluded are hardware adapters listed in `scripts/coverage-exclusions.txt`:

| File | Why it can't run in a unit test | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `Sources/NopeCapture/SystemCameraAuthorization.swift` | Requesting access shows a system prompt | On-device check |
| `Sources/NopeSigning/SecureEnclaveSigningKey.swift` | The Simulator has no Secure Enclave | On-device check |

Each excluded file is a thin wrapper; its logic lives in a tested file. `NopeUI` is not part of
the coverage gate: it is covered by UI tests and accessibility audits instead.

## UI tests and accessibility audits

```sh
xcodebuild test -project App/NopeCamera.xcodeproj -scheme NopeApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro,OS=27.2' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

`NopeAppUITests` launches the app, runs `performAccessibilityAudit()` on the permission screen,
allows access, and audits the ready screen. Every new screen and state adds an audit.

## Documentation

```sh
scripts/check-docs.sh DerivedData          # check
scripts/check-docs.sh DerivedData --write  # update docs/api/ after changing a doc comment
```

It builds the DocC documentation with warnings as errors, fails if a public or internal symbol
has no DocC comment of its own, and fails if `docs/api/` doesn't match the code.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs on GitHub-hosted runners with the `xcode-27` image and Xcode
27.2 (the image's default is 27.1; the workflow selects 27.2 through `DEVELOPER_DIR` to match
the local toolchain). Jobs:

| Job | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `unit-tests` | Coverage gate tests, NopeKit unit tests on the iOS 27.2 Simulator, the coverage gate |
| `ui-tests` | App build and the UI smoke test with accessibility audits |
| `docs` | `scripts/check-docs.sh` |

`.github/workflows/repo-checks.yml` (`repo-checks`) runs the quick checks above.

## On-device checks

Some behavior can only be checked on hardware. Before a release, on at least one iPhone and one
iPad:

- the camera permission prompt shows the localized `NSCameraUsageDescription`, and each answer
  leads to the right screen (`SystemCameraAuthorization`);
- a Secure Enclave key signs and verifies (`SecureEnclaveSigningKey`);
- the manual accessibility pass in AGENTS.md (VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control, the
  largest text size).

The full release audit is in AGENTS.md, "Before any release, a full security audit must pass".
